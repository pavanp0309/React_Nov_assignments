node_modules/
When you install something using npm install, all the tools (libraries like React, Vite, etc.) are stored here. You should not edit anything here manually we can just use it.

public/
It contains the files that don’t need to be changed. These files are directly sent to the browser — they are not processed or changed by Vite.

src/
This is your main working area. All your React code, components, and styles are here. Whatever you build inside src — Vite will bundle (combine and optimize) it for you.


Inside src/

App.jsx
This is your main React component (root of your UI). Usually defines what appears on your home screen.

App.css

index.css
Global CSS for your whole app (applied everywhere).

main.jsx
This is like the starting point of your website. It connects your React app to the index.html page.

vite.config.js
This file controls how Vite works. You can change settings like: Port number (which you open in browser), Adding plugins, Setting custom paths.

eslint.config.js

package-lock.json
This file makes sure your project uses the exact same versions of libraries every time — so it doesn’t break. You don’t edit it; it’s created automatically.

This is just an information file about your project. Usually, it explains how to run or install it — like a small guide for others (or you later).

.gitignore
This file tells Git which files/folders to skip when you upload your project to GitHub. Example: you don’t want to upload node_modules because it’s huge.
